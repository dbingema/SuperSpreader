# SuperSpreader

Simulation of the effect of super spreaders during a Corona virus outbreak. Super spreaders are individuals who infect several other people, while the majority of the infected do not infect other (or at most one person). This slight tail in the distribution leads to a very unexpected behavior in the spread of the virus.
