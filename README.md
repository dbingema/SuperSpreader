# SuperSpreader

Simulation of the effect of super spreaders during a Corona virus outbreak. Super spreaders are individuals who infect several other people, while the majority of the infected do not infect other (or at most one person). This slight tail in the distribution leads to a very unexpected behavior in the spread of the virus.

Written in Python using the streamlit package to allow interative simulations.

## Instructions

Vary the shape of the distribution for the probability of the number of infected others per infected person. 

* Maximum Position - shift the distribution right or left
* Width of the distribution - make the distribution wider or narrower
* Asymmetry - change the length of the tail of the distribution

The simulation updates the entire calculation, which can take a few seconds, be patient when changing the sliders.
